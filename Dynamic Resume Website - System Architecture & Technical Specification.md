```

### Component Interaction Flow

The system's component interaction follows a request-response pattern with clear data flow boundaries. When a user accesses the public resume view, the Next.js application renders the page server-side, fetching initial data from the Spring Boot API during the build process or at request time, depending on the rendering strategy employed.

For administrative functions, the flow begins with user authentication through the login interface. Upon successful authentication, the Spring Boot backend generates a JWT token that the frontend stores securely and includes in subsequent API requests. The admin interface then enables real-time editing of resume content, with changes immediately reflected in the database and subsequently visible on the public view.

The API layer implements RESTful principles with proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and response formatting. Each endpoint follows consistent patterns for request validation, business logic execution, and response generation. The system employs optimistic locking for concurrent edit scenarios and implements proper transaction management for data consistency.

### Security Architecture

Security implementation spans multiple layers, from transport encryption to application-level authorization. The system employs HTTPS for all communications, ensuring data privacy and integrity during transmission. At the application level, Spring Security manages authentication and authorization through a comprehensive filter chain.

JWT tokens provide stateless authentication, enabling horizontal scaling while maintaining security. Token expiration and refresh mechanisms prevent unauthorized access while ensuring smooth user experience. The system implements role-based access control, distinguishing between public users and administrative users with appropriate permission levels.

Input validation occurs at multiple levels, including client-side validation for user experience and server-side validation for security. The system employs parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and implements proper output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

## Database Schema Design

The database schema reflects the hierarchical nature of resume data while maintaining normalization principles and query performance. The design supports flexible content management while ensuring data integrity through proper constraints and relationships.

### Core Entities

**User Entity**: Represents the administrative user with authentication credentials and profile information. The entity includes fields for username, encrypted password, email, and role assignments. The design supports future expansion to multiple users while maintaining current single-user requirements.

```

## Security Implementation Strategy

Security implementation encompasses multiple layers of protection, from network-level security to application-level authorization. The strategy addresses common web application vulnerabilities while maintaining usability and performance.

### Authentication and Authorization

The system implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. JWT tokens contain minimal user information and include expiration timestamps to limit exposure risk. The token payload includes user ID, role, and issued/expiration timestamps, signed with a secure secret key.

Token refresh mechanisms enable long-term sessions while maintaining security through regular token rotation. The system implements proper token invalidation on logout and includes mechanisms for emergency token revocation if security breaches are detected.

Role-based access control distinguishes between public access (read-only resume viewing) and administrative access (full CRUD operations). The system supports future expansion to multiple user roles while maintaining current single-admin requirements.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

Comprehensive input validation occurs at multiple layers, including client-side validation for user experience and server-side validation for security. The system employs whitelist-based validation approaches, defining acceptable input patterns rather than attempting to filter malicious content.

Data sanitization processes remove or encode potentially dangerous characters before database storage or output rendering. The system implements proper output encoding based on context (HTML, JSON, URL) to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

File upload functionality, if implemented, includes strict file type validation, size limits, and virus scanning capabilities. Uploaded files are stored outside the web root with randomized names to prevent direct access or execution.

### Database Security

Database security implementation includes parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, connection pooling with proper credential management, and database-level access controls. The system employs least-privilege principles, granting only necessary permissions to application database users.

Database connections utilize encrypted channels (SSL/TLS) to protect data in transit. Connection strings and database credentials are stored securely using environment variables or secure configuration management systems, never hardcoded in application source code.

Regular database backups with encryption ensure data recovery capabilities while maintaining confidentiality. Backup storage follows secure practices with access controls and retention policies appropriate for the data sensitivity level.

### Network Security

All communications between client and server utilize HTTPS with strong cipher suites and proper certificate management. The system implements HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent protocol downgrade attacks and ensures secure cookie transmission.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration restricts API access to authorized domains while supporting the frontend application's requirements. The configuration follows least-privilege principles, allowing only necessary origins, methods, and headers.

Rate limiting implementation prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks by limiting request frequency per IP address or authenticated user. The system includes progressive penalties for repeated violations and whitelist capabilities for trusted sources.
